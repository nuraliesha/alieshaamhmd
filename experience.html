		<ul style="font-size: 20px;">
			<li>Worked at the Hyper shoes shoe store<br />
While waiting for form 5 admission, I spent my holidays in working for a while in a shoe store to earn more money and added experience to get a feel for how to make a living to help my family. At the same time, I was able to learn how to manage shoe sizes in different countries, such as Euro, UK, and US sizes. With that, I was able to learn to organize the shoe inventory more systematically according to the shoe code, to make it easier to find the shoes.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>Active in all physical and mental activities<br />
I have joined a co -curricular body that is Komander Kesatria is an association of commanders who are active in various physical events that are very hardcore such as involving endurance, where it is a long-distance run that requires acceleration, not only that, but the event is also in a very perspective both by involving academics and a positive impact on contemporary users with a scientific event. Not only that, but this association also teaches volunteer activities, where it can give a positive impact to the community, in time can increase my spirituality because I can help the community to help and tidy their homes.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>Active in sports activities<br />
Since I entered UiTM Rembau college, I really don't like leisure, because for me it is a waste of time, after meeting friends and being active in the Komander Kesatria association, I have become accustomed to sports activities even during holidays, such as, running, jogging, frisbee, badminton, volleyball, handball and futsal, it makes me fun to go down for leisure every evening because it can relieve stress and can practice a healthy life.<br /><br /></li>
